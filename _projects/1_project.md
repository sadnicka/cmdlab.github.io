 We group patients with movement disorders into core categories called **phenotypes** depending the nature of dysfunctional movement. Many 100s of different neural insults or diseases collapse down onto these limited number of phenotypes and we understand poorly why the sensorimotor system appears to fail in a limited number of ways. Human pose estimation leverages deep learning methods to track human pose from video.  Such methods allow us to fully capture human movement disorders tracking all body regions to millimetre precision over time.  Such data invites us to move towards a quantitative framework for human movement disorders, progressing beyond ambiguous semantic definitions that can have low reliability.  Such quantification will unlock both the invariant features of each phenotype but also quantify the variability.   
 
In a major five year project funded by the Wellcome Trust we will study patients with hyperkinetic movement disroders such as chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, tics and tremor.  We will explore the behavioural statistics for each disorder and model movement from different mathematical perspectives. Key goals are: 1) Define the feature space and boundaries of each phenotype 2) Model the behavioural signatures for each phenotype 3) Evaluate which behavioural tasks have the most 'signal' for each phenotype 4) Reveal how a data-led clustering of hyperkinetic movement compares to current clinical classification. Working with a talented multi-disciplinary team across world-leading computational and clinical neurosciences centres this project promises to yield important insights!
