 We group patients with movement disorders into core categories called **phenotypes** depending the nature of dysfunctional movement. Many hundreds of different neural insults or diseases collapse down onto these limited number of phenotypes and we understand poorly why the sensorimotor system appears to fail in this limited number of ways. Technology such as markerbased and markerless motion capture, wireless neurophysiology allows us to sample human movement disorders freely in naturalistic settings.  Such high dimensional data requires computational methods to look at human movement disorders with differnet lenses with greater mathematical abstraction.  The aim is to reveal the invariant features of each phenotype and also characterise  variability.   

 In a major five year project funded by the Wellcome Trust we will study patients with **hyperkinetic** movement disroders such as chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, tics and tremor, capturing movement whilst participants perform a range of tasks.  Key goals are to: 1) Define the feature space and boundaries of each phenotype 2) Model the behavioural signatures for each phenotype 3) Evaluate which behavioural tasks have the most 'signal' for each phenotype 4) Reveal how a data-led clustering of hyperkinetic movement compares to current clinical classification.
