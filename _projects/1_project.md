 We group patients with movement disorders into core categories called **phenotypes** depending the nature of dysfunctional movement. Many hundreds of different neural insults or diseases collapse down onto these limited number of phenotypes and we understand poorly why the sensorimotor system appears to fail in this limited number of ways. Technology such as motion capture and wireless neurophysiology allows us to sample human movement disorders freely in naturalistic settings.  Such high dimensional data requires modern machine learning methods to make sense of the data, each modellining tool a different lens.  In a major five year project funded by the Wellcome Trust we will study patients with **hyperkinetic** disroders such as chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, tics and tremor.  We want to approximate the kinematic statistics, defining both the invariant features and their variability.
