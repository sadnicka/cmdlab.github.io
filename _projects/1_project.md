 We group patients with movement disorders into core categories called **phenotypes** depending the nature of dysfunctional movement. Many 100s of different neural insults or diseases collapse down onto these limited number of phenotypes and we understand poorly why the sensorimotor system appears to fail in a limited number of ways. Human pose estimation leverages deep learning methods to track human pose from video.  Such methods allow us to fully capture human movement tracking any movement disorder to millimetre precision over time.  This data invites us to move towards a quantitative framework for human movement disorders, progressing beyond ambiguous semantic definitions that can have low reliability.  Quantification will reveal invariant features of each phenotype but also characterise  variability.   
 
In a major five year project funded by the Wellcome Trust we will study patients with hyperkinetic movement disroders such as chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, tics and tremor.  We will capture their movement while they perform a range of tasks.  Key goals are to: 1) Define the feature space and boundaries of each phenotype 2) Model the behavioural signatures for each phenotype 3) Evaluate which behavioural tasks have the most 'signal' for each phenotype 4) Reveal how a data-led clustering of hyperkinetic movement compares to current clinical classification.
