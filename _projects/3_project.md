Dystonia is a dynamic disorder of sensorimotor control.  In many other countries physiotherapy plays an essential role in management.  In the UK it rarely features.  If we were to be provcative we would claim we can cure some types with strategic physiotherpay and relieve disability in most.  The lack of physiotherapy provision in the UK requires urgent revision and we aim to do this by slowly building the evidence base of efficacy and increasing the scientific rationale. For example, in task-specfic dystonia we are developing programs for rehabiltiation that are multimodal and integrate novel eleements that have their base in recent reserach work such as differential learning.
