Dystonia is a dynamic disorder of sensorimotor control.  In many other countries physiotherapy plays an essential role in management, in the UK it rarely features.  We can likely cure subtypes of dystonia with strategic physiotherpay and relieve disability in all.  Our national survey has revealed an urgent need for better provision.  Our clinical and scientific work seeks to build the evidence base for efficacy and define the scientific rationale. In task-specfic dystonia we have trialled multimodal rehabilitation approahces and are collaborate with performance arts centres to deliver novel methods of retraining such as differential learning.  In cervical dystonia we take observations from the natural statistics of head movements to integrate freedom back into head movements, building on existing trategies with already proven efficacy.
