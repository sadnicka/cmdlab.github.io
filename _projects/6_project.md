Differential learning principles can be used within neuro-physiotherapy strategies to create novel treatments for patients.  Differential learning forces an individual to perform every movement repetition in a different way.  Thereotically, injecting variability in to movements helps neural sensorimotor control centres expand the space of solutions they can use to optimise performance for a given goal.  Ongoing projects in the lab are developing this method and quantifing outcomes using motion capture and wireless EMG.
