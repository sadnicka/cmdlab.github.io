Despite the gross motor disability many core motor control computations appear to be intact. For example, accuracy, reaction times,  motor learning such as [adaptation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21545-0) are intact. Since dystonia is predominantly a disorder of postural control a shift of experimental focus to mirror the clinical phenotype is highly revealing. A current line of investigations explore the neural control of hold and how well preceeding arm movements inform (integrate) an upcoming arm posture.  Part of an international collaboration with motor control scientists Professor Joseph Galea, University of Birmingham and Professor Reza Shadmehr, John Hopkins University School of Medicine, USA.
