We have run a number of experiments using patinets with DYT-TOR1A dystonia as a well characterised patient model for generalised idiopathic dystonias.  Despite the gross motor disability many core motor control computations within movement appear to be intact. For example, if increased motor variabiltiy is modelled [motor learning such as adaptation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21545-0) (often conceptualised as a cerebellar paradigm) is intact. Associative learning (eye-blink conditioning), another 'cerebellar' paradgims also appears to be intact. Mirroring the main clinical deficit, a disorder of postural control, we have shifted our experimental focus to the neural control of hold.  We have also investigated how well preceeding arm movements inform (integrate) an upcoming arm posture.
