We have run a number of experiments using patinets with DYT-TOR1A dystonia, a genetic dystonia that usually results in a generalised idiopathic dystonias ...

Despite the gross motor disability many core motor control computations within movement appear to be intact. For example, if increased motor variabiltiy is modelled [motor learning such as adaptation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21545-0) (often conceptualised as a cerebellar paradigm) is intact. 

Since dystonia is classically a disorder of postural control we have therefore shifted shifted our experimental focus to mirror the clinical phenotype and have examined the neural control of hold.  We have also investigated how well preceeding arm movements inform (integrate) an upcoming arm posture.
