Task-specific dystonia has a number of features that identify it as an outlier from other dystonias.  The range of environmental influences and association with specific tasks offer windows into mechanism if interpreted with the right tools.  Furthermore, the unreliability of traditional neurophysiological markers and canonical somatotopy model motivate the need for alternative ways to understand the disorders.  We tried to offer another perspective that integrated a modern neuroscientific literature in skill learning with decades of clinical reserach in patients.  This offers a neural architecture and vocabulary to describe different deficits and predicts the efficacy of treatments such as differential learning which we discovered after arriving at a similar formulation to other groups.  Such insights offer an optimistic perspective on task-specific dystonia.  It should no longer be considered untreatable.  It responds well to specialist botulinum toxin injections, surgical options are also offered at a number of centres and movements can be retrained by reboosting natural variability!

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
