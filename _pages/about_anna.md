Anna Sadnicka is a Consultant Clinical Academic and leads the CMD Lab. 

My PhD at University College London (UCL) explored the **Role of the Cerebellum in the Dystonia** and I used neurophysiology, robotics and psychophysics to probe this topic from a range of perspectives. My funding was a prestigious Guarantors of Brain Clinical Research Fellowship within the [Association of British Neurologists](https://www.theabn.org/page/abn_fellowship) scheme and I was supervised by Mark Edwards and John Rothwell.  

I was then awarded a *Chadburn Clinical Lectureship* at St Georgeâ€™s University of London (SGUL) and completed my clinical neurology training whilst we established the *Motor Control and Movement Disorders Group*.  Working as a Principal Investigator, I continued work exploring mechanism in **dystonia** and f**unctional neurological disorders** and won additional project funding from the Royal Society, SGUL and Rosetree Trust.

In 2023, I joined the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit) as a *Senior Clinical Research Fellow* mentored by Maneesh Sahani.  A [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/) early career award has supported this transition and has allowed me to establish the CMD Lab.  I am also an Honorary Senior Lecturer at the [Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/research-departments/department-clinical-and-movement-neurosciences) and an Honorary Consultant Neurologist at the [National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/find-consultant/dr-anna-sadnicka) where I see patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders in a weekly clinic headed by Tom Warner.
