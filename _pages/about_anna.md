Anna Sadnicka is a Consultant Clinical Academic and leads the CMD Lab. 

My PhD at University College London (UCL) explored the role of the cerebellum in dystonia.  I was awarded the prestigious Guarantors of Brain Clinical Research Fellowship within the [Association of British Neurologists](https://www.theabn.org/page/abn_fellowship) scheme and was supervised by Mark Edwards and John Rothwell.  I used neurophysiology, robotics and psychophysics to probe this topic from a range of perspectives.  I published over 20 peer reviewed articles and my work was recognised with National and International awards.  

I was then awarded a Chadburn Clinical Lecturership at St Georgeâ€™s University of London (SGUL) and continued collaborative work as an Honorary Research Fellow at UCL.  Additional project funding was competitively awarded by the Royal Society, SGUL and the Rosetree Trust.

At the end of my lectureship, I joined the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit) as a Senior Clinical Research Fellow mentored by Maneesh Sahani.  [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/) funding has supported this transition and has allowed me to establish the CMD Lab.  We collect experimental data in purpose built labs at the [Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/research-departments/department-clinical-and-movement-neurosciences) where I am an Honorary Senior Lecturer. As a Honorary Consultant Neurologist at the [National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/find-consultant/dr-anna-sadnicka) I see patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders in a weekly clinic headed by Tom Warner.
