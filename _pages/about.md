We are an interdisciplinary group that believe many of the core research questions in movement disorders can be best approached with insights from diverse fields. We are based at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit) a research center dedicated to theoretical and computational neuroscience and collect patient data in purpose built labs at the [Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/research/research-departments/department-clinical-and-movement-neurosciences).

Our mission is to better understand human movement disorders so that our research creates new treatment options for patients. Using motion capture and wireless neurophysiology we sample of human movement disorders within naturalistic settings.  We apply motor control theory and computational modelling to characterise the behavioural statistics of clinical phenomenology. In many disorders, unless we can reliably quantify and understand behaviour, circuit-level mechanism will remain elusive. Outputs from our research directly inform neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation strategies for patients.
